# Ansible
ansible stðŸ‘€fs

ToDo:

0. Get ansible environment up - Container(s) with ansible/galaxy/plugins
1. Configure environment - ESX/vCenter/what have you
2. Deploy - light touch, looking at Terraform here, but learning w/ VMware and Ansible
3. Configure - default apps, settings
4. Patch - Queries and application
5. Reporting, monitoring, alerting
6. Interface/consume - User portals for requests, approvals, etc (AWX/Tower/something else?)
7. CI/CD work?  Probably break out of this repo?
